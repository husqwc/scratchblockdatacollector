# About
This is a python script which crawls Scratch projects and collects data about block usage. The result is stored in a CSV file.

# Requirements
This uses [scratchattach](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach) to fetch data from Scratch projects.

The path file where the CSV is generated can be changed at the top of the file.
