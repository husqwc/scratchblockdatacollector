# About
This is a python script which crawls Scratch projects and collects data about block usage. The result is stored in a CSV file.

# Requirements
This uses [scratchattach](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach) to fetch data from Scratch projects. A keyboard library is also used to stop the script, although this can be easily interchanged for something else.

The path file where the CSV is generated can be changed at the top of the file.
